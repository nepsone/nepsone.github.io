Nepsone ehf has been awarded a grant from Tækniþróunarsjóður (Technology Development Fund) of Rannís (The Icelandic Centre for Research). The award for 50 mISK will support the preclinical development of a topical psoriasis treatment based on Nepsone’s novel neuro-immunological theory on the origins of psoriasis. Psoriasis patients have not received a novel mechanism of action in the form of a topical treatment in over 20 years.
